These are the ranks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen,\n","King, and Ace. We can easily store this as an integer from 2 to 14.

Let's store this in a string.\n","We should be able to access this by calling `.suit` on a `Card`:\n","\n","``` python\n",">>> Card(4, \"D\").suit\n","'D'\n","```\n","\n","##### repr\n","We should override the `__repr__` function of our `Card` class so that it will print nicely. We'll write this\n","to print out \"[rank] of [suit]\" where [rank] is the rank of our card and [suit] is its suit. For example:\n","\n","``` python\n",">>> Card(7, 'H')\n","7 of Hearts\n","```\n","\n","##### Comparison functions\n","For some games, we may wish to compare the ranks of two `Card`s against each other.

It can simply be initialized as `my_deck = Deck()` or you can explicitly pass in whether to shuffle\n","the deck: `my_shuffled_deck = Deck(True)`.

It may start with any suit, but it should follow the order 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, J, Q, K, A, 2, 3, 4, ..., K,\n","A for each suit. We should be able to access this through a `shuffled` parameter:\n","\n","``` python\n",">>> Deck().shuffled\n","False\n","\n",">>> Deck(shuffled=True).shuffled\n","True\n","```\n","\n","##### shuffle \n","A `Deck` object won't do us any good for playing games if we can't shuffle it! We'll write a function\n","called `shuffle` that will allow us to shuffle our deck. This will take no parameters. Instead, it will simply be called\n","as `my_deck.shuffle()`. You may find the [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) module helpful here.\n","\n","##### deal_card\n","A `Deck` object should be able to deal `Card`s off the top. We'll write a function `deal_card` that\n","returns the `Card` object at the top of the deck. That is, we might create a `Deck` and pull the top card off like so:\n","\n","``` python\n",">>> my_deck = Deck()\n",">>> my_deck.deal_card()\n","2 of Clubs\n","\n",">>> my_deck = Deck()\n",">>> my_deck.shuffle()\n",">>> my_deck.deal_card()\n","Queen of Spades\n","```\n","\n","This function should also increment our variable tracking the number of `Card`s we've dealt.
