Specifically, the Caesar cipher shifts each letter of the alphabet by some fixed amount, wrapping at the end of the alphabet and ignoring whitespace. For example, the string\n","\n","```\n","CogWorks is fun\n","```\n","\n","encoded using a Caesar cipher with shift 3 becomes\n","\n","```\n","FrjZrunv lv ixq\n","```\n","\n","Let's break down how this works. We'll order the alphabet so that lowercase letters come before capital letters. This gives us:\n","\n","```\n","abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n","```\n","\n","The Caesar cipher will shift each letter by some amount. In our case, we chose to shift by 3 characters. This means we'll map `a` to `d`, `b` to `e`, ..., `w` to `z`, `x` to `A`, ... `W` to `Z`, `X` to `a`, `Y` to `b`, and `Z` to `c`. We can create a mapping just like this:\n","\n","```\n","abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n","defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabc\n","```\n","\n","This is essentially what the Caesar cipher is doing. Now if we want to encode our string, we see that `C` maps to `F`, `o` maps to `r`, and so on.\n","\n","Reversing the process to decode a string is quite straightforward. If we receive the encrypted string\n","\n","```\n","Wlys yvjrz\n","```\n","\n","and we know that it was encoded using a Caesar cipher with shift 7, we can easily create our reverse substitution alphabet:\n","\n","```\n","hijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefg\n","abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n","```\n","\n","and decode the message:\n","\n","```\n","Perl rocks\n","```\n","\n","Fun fact: The ROT13 algorithm is a famous special case of the Caesar cipher. It assumes all letters are the same case. What's special about ROT13 is that it is its own inverse: you apply the exact same function to both encode and decode your string.\n","\n","#### Breaking the Caesar Cipher\n","While not very secure, the Caesar cipher can be effective as a very weak form of encryption. Note that to break the encryption, we can simply try shift amounts from 1 through 25 and see which one comes out as correct English.
