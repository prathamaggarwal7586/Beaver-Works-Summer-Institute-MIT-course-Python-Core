Each participant is asked to list their favorite foods along with its category (e.g. dessert, snack, fruit). The food and category are separated by a colon, and each food-category pair is separated by a comma like so\n","\n","```food: category, food: category, food: category, ... ```\n","\n","The results of this survey are stored in a text file, `results.txt`, giving us a great opportunity to practice our file reading skills!\n","\n","Our task is to write a function called `get_most_popular_foods` that takes a file path of survey results and returns the most common response for each food category in the form of a dictionary where the keys are the food categories and the values are the most common food of that type. If there is a tie, return the food that comes first alphabetically. Note, we don't know which food categories will be given before reading the file.\n","\n","So, if we had data in the file `example.txt` with the contents below\n","\n","``` granola bars: snack, shrimp: seafood\n","granola bars: snack\n","tuna: seafood ```\n","\n","Our function would produce the following result\n"," ``` python\n"," >>> get_most_popular_foods('example.txt')\n","  {'snack': 'granola bars', 'seafood': ' shrimp'}\n"," ```\n"," \n"," The `collections.Counter` object will be useful for this problem. Also, the function `itertools.chain` may come in handy.\n"," \n","For reference, there is a short example input under `resources/example-survey.txt`. On this input, your function should produce the response as follows\n"," ``` python\n",">>> get_most_popular_foods('resources/example-survey.txt')\n"," {'dessert': 'cake', 'vegetable': 'carrots',
